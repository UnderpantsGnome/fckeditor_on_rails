README for FCKeditor on Rails

This can now be used as a plugin with both Engines and appable_plugins.

Q: What is it? 
A: A Rails like way to use the FCKeditor in a Rails app, it basically works 
	 just like the normal helpers.
	
It supports the "default" upload interface, I've thought about mcpuk support
but since I'm not even using this in any projects currently I don't have the
need or the time to implement all that mcpuk does. Maybe one of these days.

Sample usage:
	fckeditor(:object, :param, 
		{:width => '600px', :height => '500px'}, # fck options
		{:class => 'fancy'} # html options
	)

Basic install:
	./script/plugin install http://svn.underpantsgnome.com/fckeditor_on_rails
	
	Drop a current copy of FCKeditor into public/fckeditor and setup whichever
	method below you are using

	appable_plugins info: http://wiki.pluginaweek.org/Appable_plugins

	Required plugins (in proper load order) for using the appable_plugins:
		loaded_plugins 
		plugin_dependencies 
		plugin_routing 
		appable_plugins 
		fckeditor_on_rails


	Rails Engines info: http://rails-engines.org/

	Required plugins (in proper load order) for using Engines:
		engines
		fckeditor_on_rails

	By default it attempts to copy a functional test into your project, if you
	don't want it running the tests just remove 
	test/functional/fckeditor_controller_test.rb

Uninstall:
	./script/plugin remove fckeditor_on_rails
	This will also remove the installed functional test
