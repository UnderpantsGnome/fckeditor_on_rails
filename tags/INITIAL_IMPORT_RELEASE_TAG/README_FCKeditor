README for FCKeditor on Rails

To install:
	install FCKeditor into your app under public/fckeditor

	extract fckeditor_on_rails into your app

	add the environment settings found in
		config/environment.rb.fck_settings
		to config/environment.rb

		if you want to use a different base dir than /fckeditor/
		you will need to use the included patched fckeditor.js

	copy the fckeditor() helper into app/helpers/application_helper.rb
		or add helper :fckeditor into the controller(s) you want access from

	startup the server and go to /fckeditor where you will find a test page
		this page has been configured to display nothing if in any
		environment other than development

Useage:
	In the simplest case useage would be
	<%= fckeditor(:object, :param, {:width => '600px', :height => '500px'}) -%>

	See index.rhtml for other options
